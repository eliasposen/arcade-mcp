Tool Metadata

Defines the metadata model for Arcade tools. This module provides three layers:

- Classification: What type of service the tool interfaces with (ServiceDomain).
  Used for tool discovery and search boosting.

- Behavior: What effects the tool has (operations, MCP-aligned flags).
  MCP Annotations are computed from this.
  Commonly used for policy decisions (HITL gates, retry logic, etc.)

- Extras: Arbitrary key/values for custom logic (IDP routing, feature flags, etc.)
